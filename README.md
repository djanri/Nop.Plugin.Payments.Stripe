# Stripe payment provides for NopCommerce

This Payment provider supports Stripe's credit card payment gateway. 

## Features

 - Uses Stripe's native client-side secure payment forms (Stripe.js + Elements), so no credit card numbers pass through the server
 - Support for full and partial refunds
 - Postal code data automatically passes through to the Stripe forms, so the user doesn't have to reenter it on the Stripe form
 - Postal code and CVC verification are implemented
 
## Limitations

Since this is an open source project, anyone is welcome to send pull requests that address these limits, where possible.
